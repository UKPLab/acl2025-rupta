This is the official code of the paper "Robust Utility-Preserving Text Anonymization Based on Large Language Models".

> **Abstract:** Text anonymization is crucial for sharing sensitive data while maintaining privacy. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of re-identification attack ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and patterns as well as connecting disparate pieces of information. In defending against LLM-based re-identification attacks, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks---the trade-off between privacy and data utility requires deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. This paper proposes a framework composed of three LLM-based components---a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. To provide a practical model for large-scale and real-time environments, we distill the anonymization capabilities into a lightweight model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

## Getting Started
### Dataset


### Environment
If you want to set up this template:

1. Request a repository on UKP Lab's GitHub by following the standard procedure on the wiki. It will install the template directly. Alternatively, set it up in your personal GitHub account by clicking **[Use this template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/generate)**.
2. Wait until the first run of CI finishes. Github Actions will commit to your new repo with a "✅ Ready to clone and code" message.
3. Delete optional files: 
    - If you don't need automatic documentation generation, you can delete folder `docs`, file `.github\workflows\docs.yml` and `mkdocs.yml`
    - If you don't want automatic testing, you can delete folder `tests` and file `.github\workflows\tests.yml`
4. Prepare a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt # Only needed for development
```
5. Adapt anything else (for example this file) to your project. 

6. Read the file [ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md](ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md)  for more information about development.

## Usage

### Using the classes

To import classes/methods of `ukp_project_template` from inside the package itself you can use relative imports: 

```py
from .base import BaseClass # Notice how I omit the package name

BaseClass().something()
```

To import classes/methods from outside the package (e.g. when you want to use the package in some other project) you can instead refer to the package name:

```py
from ukp_project_template import BaseClass # Notice how I omit the file name
from ukp_project_template.subpackage import SubPackageClass # Here it's necessary because it's a subpackage

BaseClass().something()
SubPackageClass().something()
```

### Using scripts

This is how you can use `ukp_project_template` from command line:

```bash
$ python -m ukp_project_template
```

### Expected results

After running the experiments, you should expect the following results:

(Feel free to describe your expected results here...)

### Parameter description

* `x, --xxxx`: This parameter does something nice

* ...

* `z, --zzzz`: This parameter does something even nicer

## Development

Read the FAQs in [ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md](ABOUT_THIS_TEMPLATE.md) to learn more about how this template works and where you should put your classes & methods. Make sure you've correctly installed `requirements-dev.txt` dependencies
